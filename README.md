To use the desktop app which provides buttons for easy download, as tkinter comes preinstalled with python,
just clone this repository or directly download Desktop_app.py python program, modify the program to replace
USERNAME and PASSWORD with the username and password of your account you intend to use for downloading.Run the
application, select your folder for saving the downloads, type in the username whose content you wish to download and then press on the button for what you need. Currently(March 3rd 25,5am IST) unfortunately
there are bugs asocuated with full reels download and download all posts and latest reel button
so currrently only stories and latest post button works. This will be resolved very soon within the next two days itself.
